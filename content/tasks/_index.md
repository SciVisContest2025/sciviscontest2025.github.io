A long time series is part of the scientific objectives but the total amount of data is moderately large and the number of files is large.  The following tasks target the COVIS imaging data and are a possible list of tasks a submission can follow. This is, however, only a suggestion and can be altered and extended by the participants:

1. Extract and visualize plumes to effectively showcase changes in bending and structure
2. Extract plume centerlines or otherwise quantify plume characteristics such as bending direction and degree, backscatter intensity gradients, and heat flux
3. A more sophisticated gridding or plume extraction that starts from the raw data rather than gridded data 

Besides the overall first, second, and third place winners, this year's jury will additionally award prizes to the: 

- best report cover visualization
- most innovative approach
