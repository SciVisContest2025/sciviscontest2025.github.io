Data was generated focusing on the combination of different Al-based scrap alloys.

\> 100,000 combinations of 6 scrap metals were generated by Latin hypercube sampling and their output parameters were simulated, resulting in a table with a total of >100,000 rows and 70 columns. Each row indicates a specific simulated material combination in terms of inputs and outputs. 

The columns contain 6 input parameters (i.e. the mixing ratio for each scrap) and 64 output parameters. 
The data can be divided into 4 categories:
- (1) scrap alloys for mixing 
- (2) calculated chemical composition after scrap mixing (12 elements) 
- (3) microstructure (38 microstructural parameters)
- (4) properties (3 mechanical parameters + 11 thermophysical parameters). 

To summarize, this data contains:
- **.csv file (~100 MB)**
- **\> 100000 lines à each line indicates data for one alloy design**
- **70 columns à 6 input variables, 64 output variables**
