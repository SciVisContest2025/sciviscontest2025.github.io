This year, the contest is looking into the visualization-based discovery of novel materials in recycling: Al-Si piston alloys are highly specialized regarding their use in combustion engines. Due to the current shift towards e-mobility, the future use of these materials remains largely unclear, although a large amount of components made of these alloys will be available in the upcoming years due to recycling. For these reasons, the future use of respective Al scrap needs to be determined. The hypothesis in terms of the material discovery challenge is that a mixture of a number of alloys (3-6 alloys) can yield novel alloy designs with superior properties to be used in future products. 

Challenge 1
Material Scientists are increasingly employing simulation to determine the properties of combinations of novel alloy candidates. Due to the complexity of the simulation and respective computational efforts, only a subset can be simulated by sampling of combinations. Yet, a severe challenge is found in understanding simulated data due size and scaling of the dataset. Currently, mainly parallel coordinate plots as well as scatter plots are used to get an impression of the composition – microstructure – property relationship of the alloys, i.e., only selected input and output parameters are visualized to find a correlation.

Challenge 2
Due to the complexity of the simulation and respective computational efforts, only  subsets of combinations can be sampled. The complexity of respective simulations is even further elevated when mixing more scrap materials. Subtle changes in the material decomposition may yield strong impacts in the simulated parameters. with the target of identifying  chemical compositions that possess ideal target parameters for a specific application,  optimization algorithms are used. In this challenge (intermediate) results from the multi-dimensional visualization and analysis should therefore be used to communicate with respective optimization algorithms. 


Based on this, we have provided a list of visualization [tasks](/tasks) for this contest.
