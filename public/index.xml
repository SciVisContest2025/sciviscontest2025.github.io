Please follow the formatting guidelines for the manuscript.(you can download LaTeX and Word templates from this site). Images which explain how your visualizations help answering the questions.

      <description>The PI Instrument page is found at https://oceanobservatories.org/pi-instrument/cabled-array-vent-imaging-sonar-covis/. This is the official description of COVIS for the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). COVIS data from the OOI deployment can be found at http://piweb.ooirsn.uw.edu/covis/. This folder has two subfolders ~/covis/data/ and ~/covis/processed/.
The raw data is under ~/covis/data/ which contains ~BROWSE/, ~COVIS/, ~COVIS-ENG/, and ~INPUT/. All COVIS raw data files come in a compressed file folder (&amp;hellip;tar.gz).
BROWSE - data organized in folders by year and julian day (same data as in COVIS and INPUT but reorganized in folders rather than just a long list) COVIS - incoming data from 2018 to 2020 COVIS-ENG &amp;ndash; information on COVIS operations but only 2018-2020 INPUT - incoming data from 2020 to 2023 The processed data is under ~/covis/processed/</description>
